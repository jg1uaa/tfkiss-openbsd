A quick guide to building and installing tfkiss.
------------------------------------------------

There are just a few simple steps to complete in order to build and install
tfkiss.

      1.) Unpack the tarball into a directory of your choice,
          e.g. /usr/src/contrib. This will create a subdirectory
          tfkiss-1.1.0 which contains the sources, docs and
          example configurations.

		tar zxvfp tfkiss-1.1.0.tar.gz

      2.) Go into the tfkiss-1.1.0 directory and run the "configure" 
          script.

                cd tfkiss-1.1.0
                ./configure

          The following option may be past on to "configure"

                --prefix=</installation/directory>

                        default is /usr/local 


                --enable-axip="yes"

                        use this to enable AXIP support 
                        default is AXIP disabled 

                --enable-xpid="yes"

                        use this to enable XPID support
                        default is XPID disabled 

                --enable-flexnet="yes"

                        use this to enable FLEXNET support
                        default is FLEXNET disabled 

                --enable-hibaud="yes"       (linux only)

                        enable hibaud for serial port speed => 38400
                        default is hibaud disabled


      3.) Compile sources using the "make" ("gmake" on some platforms)

                make

                        
      4.) Install package after succesful compilation of source code

                make install

          NOTE: The installation of new configuration files will be 
                suspended if a previously installed version of tfkiss 
                is detected on the system. This is to protect the old
                configuration from on the system from being deleted
                accidentally. In this case, update the configuration
                manually after consulting the documentation and
                CHANGES file.

      5.) Check and edit configuration files tfkiss.ini, tfkiss.cfg
          using a text editor. 


      6.) tfkiss is now ready for action!!!


Refer to the documentation provided with this package for more detailed
information on configuration and operation of tfkiss.


Enjoy
